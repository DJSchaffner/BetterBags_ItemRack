## BetterBags - ItemRack
This is a filter for the World of Warcraft addon [BetterBags](https://github.com/Cidan/BetterBags) and requires both [BetterBags](https://github.com/Cidan/BetterBags) and [ItemRack](https://github.com/Rottenbeer/ItemRack)

The plugin was written for Classic SoD so it might not work for other versions of the game. It does apparently work in WotLK, however it is not officially supported and might break in the future.

It will collect all items assigned to an ItemRack set and place them in a respective category. Items that are used in multiple item sets will be placed in a shared category.
