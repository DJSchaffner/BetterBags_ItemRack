## BetterBags - ItemRack
This is a filter for the World of Warcraft addon [BetterBags](https://github.com/Cidan/BetterBags) and requires both [BetterBags](https://github.com/Cidan/BetterBags) and [ItemRack](https://github.com/Rottenbeer/ItemRack)

Plugin was written for Classic SoD so it might not work for other versions of the game.

It will collect all items assigned to an ItemRack set and place them in a single category. Might add the option to split them up into seperate categories for each set later but no promises.
